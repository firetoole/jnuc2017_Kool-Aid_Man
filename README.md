#Summary
Join us in a walkthrough of the infamous Kool-Aid Man incident: how seven stolen laptops were recovered within 24 hours and the "Kool-Aid Man" was put behind bars. OH YEAH! This talk will walk through several steps you can take to recover stolen assets utilizing Jamf, Appleâ€™s Device Enrollment Program (DEP), a few open-source projects and good old-fashioned intelligence gathering. We will also go into common criminal workflows for stolen assets, how to disrupt these processes and, finally, security hygiene for Mac endpoints to help protect against physical hardware loss incidents.
